.TH FREEIPMI.HOSTMAP 5 "@ISODATE@" "FreeIPMI @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH "NAME"
freeipmi.hostmap \- specify alternate hostnames to communicate with
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The 
.B freeipmi.hostmap 
configuration file supports the ability for users to specify alternate
hostnames or IP addresses that FreeIPMI may accept.  The FreeIPMI
tools will translates these alternate hostnames/IP address to a
configured hostname/IP address.

Sometimes, administrators configure the IPMI IP addresses to be
different than the IP address of the machine host.  This is done for a
variety of reasons.  For example, administrators may wish to separate
IP networks to avoid potential mistakes.  Some may have separate
physical networks, one for IPMI and one for production use.

Sometimes remembering the alternate IPMI hostname or IP address may be
confusing.  In that case, setting up the
.B freeipmi.hostmap
may make things easier.

.SH "HOSTMAP FORMAT"
Each line of the hostmap file shall specify two strings indicating
hostname(s) or IP address(es) separated by whitespace.  The alternate
hostname/IP is listed first and the IPMI hostname/IP is listed second.
Each string may list multiple hostnames/IPs using a comma separated
format or ranged format.  If multiple hosts are specified, an equal
number of hosts must be specified for the alternate and IPMI
hostnames.  See HOSTRANGED SUPPORT below for more information on
ranged formats.  Comments can be marked by using the pound sign ("#")
character.

Please take note that the alternate hostname/IP is converted via a
direct string comparison.  Therefore, a host "foobar" will be
converted differently than "foobar.mydomain.com".

.SH "EXAMPLE"
The example below is an example of a small cluster with a management node
called foomgmt, 2 login nodes called foologin1 and foologin2, and 15 nodes
called foo0 to foo15.  The IPMI IP address is mapped to the hostnames
pfoomgmt, pfoologin1, pfoologin2, and pfoo[0-15] respectively.
