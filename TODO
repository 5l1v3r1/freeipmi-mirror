AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Unified Driver Model (one interface for all in-band and out-of-band drivers)

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
  * Different slave address than BMC as default (i.e. in fill_lan_msg_hdr)
  * Templates must be encapsulated further
  * fiid_obj_t must hold additional info
  * fiid macros - make debugging better, many are useless right now
  * only make those symbols exportable that should be exportable
  * gcc 4.0 test/warning
  * int wraparound corner cases - fiid
    - uint32_t for max_field_len, but some funcs return int32_t
    - counters, fiid_obj_create
  * test bad seq nums
  * chksum_test - confusing, not use?
  * need to test acpi
  * consistency in templates and functions
    - user_id.reserved vs. reserved vs. reserved1 etc.
    - user_name vs. username
    - channel_num vs. channel_number
    - priv_ vs. privilege
  * fill_kcs_get_sel_entry
    - why not the other arguments?
  * sensor-event-messages: get_28_event_data3_messages
  * remove ipmi_chksum_test
  * audit serial/lan/pef/sel/sensors template auditting      
    - lan-cmds 
       - clean function names (done)
       - order code appropriately (done)
       - missing commands
       - audit templates (some done)
    - msg-support-cmds
       - clean function names (done)
       - order code appropriately (done)
       - missing commands
       - audit templates
  * reg-space default  
  * udm parameter checks
  

fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.

ipmipower
---------
  * compile options to make workarounds automatic for ipmipower

General:
--------
  * sel aggregator

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme <DONE>
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
  * Code auditing
    - Templates/API/etc: Some say "username" some have "user_name".
    - Lots of functions don't check input parameters, i.e. null buffers
